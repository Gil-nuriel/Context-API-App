# Context-API-App

**This app has a minimum functionality.
It supposed to show deep understanding in the context api of react.
Every piece of state in this application pass ONLY from context providers (parent/child props was not implemented here on purpose). 
In this application you can generate a unique avatar from any kind of name, numbers, signs or adress you like. Every avatar is unique**

**This simple application build from 2 contexts providers:**
**1- Theme Context - which wrap the entire application and let you change the theme on every single component in the app**
**2- Avatar Context - which responsible on getting the data from specific components and setting this data**

## dependencies
`bootstrap`
`react-bootstrap`
`react-switch`

## Available Scripts

**use npm i in the root directory to intall all the dependecies**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
install all the dependencies to run this project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
